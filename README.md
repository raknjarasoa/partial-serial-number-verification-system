Back in 2007, developer Brandon Staggs wrote a brilliant article about software licensing, showing how to implement what he calls a Partial Serial Number Verification System using the Delphi language. 

Originally from Delphi implementation `Brandon Staggs` [Implementing a Partial Serial Number Verification System in Delphi](https://www.brandonstaggs.com/2007/07/26/implementing-a-partial-serial-number-verification-system-in-delphi/)

And from ES3 version's `Davide Barranca` [here](https://www.davidebarranca.com/2015/07/partial-serial-number-verification-system-in-javascript/)
